# C Compiler From Scratch

<p align="justify">This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/rui314/chibicc">Chibicc</a>, which is a project by <a href="https://github.com/rui314/">Rui Uyema</a>. Chibi in Japanese means small and chibicc is thus a small C compiler.</p>

<p align="justify">In this version I am using a virtual machine (called <a href="https://github.com/yamini-vm/yamini">Yamini VM</a>) and its assembler <a href="https://github.com/yamini-vm/yamasm">YamASM</a> and thus have made slight modifications to the compiled assembly code.</p>

## Folder structure

<p align="justify">I am using this repo to learn more about compilers from chibicc and have created separate directories for every commit.</p> 

**Note**:- I am using this as to learn more about compilers from Rui's repo, there may be slight modifications to the code.
