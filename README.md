# Chibicc Modified

<p align="justify"><a href="https://github.com/rui314/chibicc">Chibicc</a> is a project by <a href="https://github.com/rui314/">Rui Uyema</a>. Chibi in Japanese means small and chibicc is thus a small C compiler.</p>

<p align="justify">In this version I am using a mock ASM runtime (called <a href="https://github.com/frankhart2018/mockasm-runtime">mockasm-runtime</a>) and thus have made slight modifications to the compiled assembly code.</p>

## Folder structure

<p align="justify">I am using this repo to learn more about compilers from chibicc and have created separate directories for every commit.</p> 

**Note**:- I am using this as to learn more about compilers from Rui's repo, there may be slight modifications to the code.
